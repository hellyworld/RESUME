                    I have been working in engineering for the last eight years, from Research Engineer in Silviculture
                    to Design Engineer in Storage Facilities, and I am now looking to transition as a Python Developer.
                    With strong ability of self taught and professional development, I am eager to improve through Python
                    with Deep Learning and Machine Learning for Computer Vision.
